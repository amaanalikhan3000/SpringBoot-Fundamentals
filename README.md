# MongoDB Relationships in Spring Boot: @DBRef Annotation

## Description
This project demonstrates how to manage relationships in MongoDB using Spring Boot, with a focus on the @DBRef annotation for linking collections seamlessly. It serves as a guide for implementing relational-like behavior in NoSQL databases, making it easier to reference documents in separate collections.

MongoDB doesnâ€™t support foreign key relationships natively like traditional SQL databases. However, with the help of the @DBRef annotation in Spring Boot, we can link documents between collections to establish relationships, ensuring consistency and simplifying queries.

### Technologies Used
- Java 17+

- Spring Boot 3.x

- MongoDB

- Spring Data MongoDB

- Maven


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Java 17+ and MongoDB installed.
- Install Maven for dependency management.


### Steps

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MongoDB-SpringBoot-DBRef-Demo.git
   cd MongoDB-SpringBoot-DBRef-Demo
   ```

2. Configure MongoDB

   Modify the `application.properties` file to include your MongoDB connection details:

   ```properties
   spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost
   spring.data.mongodb.port=27017
   spring.data.mongodb.database=mydatabase
   ```

3. Run the application

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   Alternatively, build and run the JAR file:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   java -jar target/mongodb-springboot-dbref-demo.jar
   ```
